# Tables for visually impaired users.
Visually impaired people often use a screen reader that reads out information on web pages to them. 
This is no problem when you're reading plain text but interpreting a table can be quite a challenge for a blind person.
Nevertheless, with the proper markup we can replace visual associations by programmatic ones(use of scope and id slectors).

This task tests my knowledge of using the scope attribute to enable screen readers for people with visual impairment.
